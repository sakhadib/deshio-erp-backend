now the payment of #file:Order.php or #file:OrderItem.php .
by #file:Customer.php 

now, the shop customer will pay cash / card / online-pay
ecommerce option should be bank, card, onlinepay
social commerce is onlineBanking.

also we need fragmented payment. like a 500$ payment customer can pay 200$ card, 250$ cash and 50$ mobilebanking.

so this is the case.
